					<h2>What is Canvas?</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Canvas is a 2D drawing API. Essentially the browser gives you a rectangular area on the
						screen that you can draw into.
						<br>
						You can draw lines, shapes, images, text.
						<br>
						Canvas was originally created by Apple for its Dashboard widgets, but it has since been
						adopted
						by every major browser vendor and is now part of the HTML 5 spec.

						adopted by every major browser vendor and is now part of the HTML 5 specification.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Here's a quick example of what some Canvas code looks like:
					</p>
					<pre><code class="hljs html" style="word-wrap: break-word;" data-line-numbers="1-11">&lt;html&gt;	
  &lt;body&gt;
	&lt;canvas width="800" height="600" id="canvas"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
	  &lt;script&gt;
	    var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
		var c = canvas.getContext('2d');
		c.fillStyle = "red";
		c.fillRect(100, 100, 400, 300);
	  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;	
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The result for the red rectangular from the previous code:</p>
					<img width="200" height="200" src="./lib/assets/redrect.png" alt="Red rectanglar">
					<br>
					<small>This rectangle is drawn with the context.fillRect() function.</small>
					<aside class="notes">
						Finally, you can see the result for the simple red rectangular from the previous code.
						This rectangle is drawn with the context.fillRect() function.

					<h6>Note:</h6>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Canvas is for drawing pixels.</li>
							<li>It doesn't have shapes or vectors.</li>
							<li>There are no objects to attach event handlers to.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						It's important to understand that Canvas is for drawing pixels.
						It doesn't have shapes or vectors.
						There are no objects to attach event handlers to.
						It just draws pixels to the screen.
						As we shall see this is both a strength and a weakness.

					<h3>
						Comparing to the rest of the web
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's find out where it fits in with the rest of the web?
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>There are four ways to draw things on the web:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Canvas</li>
						<li>SVG</li>
						<li>CSS</li>
						<li>DOM animation</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						There are four ways to draw things on the web:
						Canvas, SVG, CSS, and direct DOM animation.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>SVG</h2>
					<p>
						<mark>SVG</mark> is a vector API that draws shapes.
						Each shape has an object that you can attach event handlers to.
						If you zoom in the shape stays smooth, whereas Canvas would become pixelated.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>CSS</h2>
					<p>
						<mark>CSS</mark> is about styling DOM elements.
						Since there are no DOM objects for things you draw in Canvas you can't use CSS to style it.
						CSS will only affect the rectangular area of the Canvas itself,
						so you can set a border and background color, but that's it.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>DOM animation</h2>
					<p>
						The <mark>DOM</mark> defines an object for everything on the
						screen.
						DOM animation, either by using CSS or JavaScript to move objects around,
						can be smoother in some cases than doing it with Canvas,
						but it depends on your browser implementation.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The Document Object Model, defines an object for everything on the
						screen.
						DOM animation, either by using CSS or JavaScript to move objects around,
						can be smoother in some cases than doing it with Canvas,
						but it depends on your browser implementation.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Usage</h3>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Use <mark>SVG</mark> when you have existing shapes that you want to render to the
								screen.</li>
							<li>Use <mark>CSS</mark> or <mark>DOM</mark> animation when you have large static areas
								that
								you wish to animate, or if you want to use 3D transforms.</li>
							<li>Use<mark>Canvas</mark> for charts, graphs, dynamic diagrams, and of
								course video games.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						So when should you use Canvas over SVG, CSS or DOM elements?
						Well, Canvas is lower level than those others so you can have
						more control over the drawing and use less memory,
						but at the cost of having to write more code.
						Use SVG when you have existing shapes that you want to render to the
						screen, like a map that came out of Adobe Illustrator.
						Use CSS or DOM animation when you have large static areas
						that you wish to animate, or if you want to use 3D transforms.
						For charts, graphs, dynamic diagrams, and of course video games,
						Canvas is a great choice.

					<h2>Browser Support</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's talk about where you can use it.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Desktop Browser</h3>
					<p>Canvas is now a stable API and most modern browsers support it to some extent.</p>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Desktop Browser </th>
								<th>Version</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Safari</td>
								<td>3.0+</td>

								<td>9.0+</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<aside class="notes">
						Fortunately Canvas is now a stable API and most modern browsers support it to some extent. Even Internet
						Explorer supports it starting with IE 9, and its implementation is very good.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Mobile Browser</h3>
					<p>Most smartphone platforms support it because most of them are based on WebKit,
						which has had long good support.</p>
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Mobile Browser </th>
								<th>Version</th>

								<td>Windows Phone 7</td>
								<td>none</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<aside class="notes">
						On the mobile side most smartphone platforms support it because most of them are based on WebKit, which has
						had long good support. WebOS, iOS, and Android support it, BlackBerry does,
						at least on the PlayBook. Windows Phone 7 does not, but it may come in a future update.

					<h2>Paths</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's talk about paths.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Paths are shapes created by a bunch of straight or curved line segments.
						In Canvas you must first define a path with beginPath(), then you can fill it, stroke it,
						or use it as a clip. You define each line segment with functions like moveTo(), lineTo(),
						and bezierCurveTo().
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Canvas only directly supports the rectangle shape. To draw any other shape you must draw it yourself using a
						path. Paths are shapes created by a bunch of straight or curved line segments. In Canvas you must first
						define a path with beginPath(), then you can fill it, stroke it, or use it as a clip. You define each line
						segment with functions like moveTo(), lineTo(), and bezierCurveTo().
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img width="450" height="200" src="./lib/assets/path.png" alt="Path">
					<p>Code for the shape above:</p>
					<pre><code>c.fillStyle = 'red';
  c.beginPath();
  c.moveTo(10,30);
  c.bezierCurveTo(50,90,159,-30,200,30);
  c.lineTo(200,90);
  c.lineTo(10,90);
  c.closePath();
  c.fill();
  c.lineWidth = 4;
  c.strokeStyle = 'black';
  c.stroke();  
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						This example draws a shape with a move to, followed by a bezier curve segment, then some
						lines.
						After creating the path it fills and strokes it.

					<h2>Coordinate System</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						A quick word on coordinate systems.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Canvas has the origin in the upper left corner with the y axis going down.
						But if you want a different origin you can do that with transforms.
						Besides, canvas spec defines coordinates at the upper left corner of a pixel.
					</p>
					<img width="500" height="400" src="./lib/assets/coords.png" alt="Coordinate System">
					<aside class="notes">
						Canvas has the origin in the upper left corner with the y axis going down. This is traditional for computer
						graphics, but if you want a different origin you can do that with transforms.
						Another important thing is that the Canvas spec defines coordinates at the upper left corner of a pixel.

					<h2>Images</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Canvas can also draw images
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Canvas can draw images with the drawImage function.
						There are several forms of drawImage:
						<br>
						You can draw the image directly to the screen at normal scale, or stretch and slice it how
						you like.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						We can draw images with the drawImage function.
						There are several forms of drawImage. You can draw the image directly to the screen at normal scale, or
						stretch and slice it how you like. Slicing and stretching images can be very handy for special effects in
						games, because image interpolation is often much faster than other kinds of scaling.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img width="700" height="200" src="./lib/assets/images.png" alt="Images">
					<pre><code>
  ctx.drawImage(img, 0,0); //normal drawing
  ctx.drawImage(img, //draw stretched
	  0,0,66,66, //source (x,y,w,h)
	  100,0,100,100//destination (x,y,w,h)
	  );
  ctx.drawImage(img, //draw a slice
	  20,10,20,20, //source coords (x,y,w,h)
	  250,0,250,50//destination coords (x,y,w,h)
	  );
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						To stretch an image you must specify the source and destination coordinates. The source coordinates tell
						drawImage where to pull the pixels from in the image.
						The destination coordinates tell the drawImage where to put the pixels on the screen. By changing the w and
						h coords you can stretch and shrink the image.

						Slicing is the same thing, but using source coordinates that don't cover the entire image. When you take a
						slice of an image be sure you don't go outside the source bounds or else the image will disappear. For
						example, if you drag the source width past 46, then it will try to access pixels beyond the right edge of
						the image. Using a negative source x coordinate will do the same

					<h2>Text</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						It's possible to draw text with Canvas as well.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						The font attribute is the same as its CSS equivalent, so you can set the style, size, and
						font family.
						The fillText(string,x,y) function draws using baseline of the text, not the top.

					<aside class="notes">
						The font attribute is the same as its CSS equivalent, so you can set the style, size, and font family. Note
						that the fillText(string,x,y) function draws using baseline of the text, not the top. If you put your text
						at 0,0 then it will be drawn off the top of the screen. Be sure to lower the y by an appropriate amount

					<h2>Gradient</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						And finally, let's see how gradients can be created using canvas.

  ctx.fillRect(0,0,400,200);
						</code>
					</pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						Here's a linear gradient. You see Canvas can also fill shapes with gradients instead of colors.
						An important thing to notice here is that gradient is painted in the coordinate system that the shape is
						drawn in, not the internal coordinates of the shape.
